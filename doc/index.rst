CAVE documentation
==================
CAVE stands for Configuration Assessment, Visualization and Evaluation.
Optimizing a target algorithm's configuration is a tiresome process of exploration.
A lot of data is usually collected, but not further looked at. CAVE aims to use
data that arises during optimization to generate plots and tables for further
insights into the optimization process and the target algorithm's behaviour.
